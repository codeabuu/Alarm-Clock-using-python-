ALARM CLOCK PROJECT USING PYTHON
..................................
An alarm clock project aims to create a program that can set and trigger alarms at specific times or intervals. It can provide features like setting alarm times, playing sounds, displaying notifications, and more.

The files were created using a script which is executable.
## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to start the alarm clock:
python alarm2.py or python alarm.py
4. Enter the desired alarm time in the format HH:MM:SS when prompted.

5. The script will continuously check the current time and display the current time until the alarm time is reached. At that point, it will print "Time to wake up and grind!".

6. To stop the script, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or command prompt.

## Customization

- You can customize the code according to your preferences. For example, you can add a snooze feature or modify the alarm message.

- To play a sound file when the alarm time is reached, you can integrate a sound library like `pygame` or `playsound`.
